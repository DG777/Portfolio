<p>Having went through a seemingly never ending cycle of iterations and refinements to my team’s initial idea of an affordable top-up kiosk and ending up creating a futuristic bus stop concept, I can say that throughout the process we constantly kept bouncing between concepts, therefore losing focus of what was important at a given moment. I, however, believe that without going through such a seemingly unnecessary complex process, we wouldn’t have been able to narrow the project’s scope down and come up with this simple, yet effective idea - a transparent multi-touch display.</p>

<p>Due natively transparent touch displays being either unavailable for sale or expensive, my team has decided to take a different route and demonstrate the display through other available technologies, such as enabling a simple piece of acrylic to become a touch display through addition of infra-red LEDs, blob tracking and rear projection, which, together, is called an FTIR method.</p>

<p>Throughout the later stages of the project our scope has gradually shifted from being focused on a bus stop itself to its transparent walls. It’s interesting how the actual bus stop design doesn’t matter as much, but the actual technology going into it does. A person can draft as many bus stop designs as they want, yet it can never replace its potential insides contents and a beautiful  streamlined interface.</p>

<p>What's on the inside you might ask? First of all, all of the software being used is open-source, which introduces a whole set of issues, such as consistent program crashes and freezes. Secondly, the tiny frame is packed full of infrared LEDs, yet on the outside it looks like a simple wooden frame.</p>

<p>Researching existing bus stop designs my team has discovered that most of them consist only of a picture and a few lines of text, there are, however, only a few concepts extensively covering most design aspects. I can’t help but wonder if people behind those designs have chosen the right direction - providing only a visual design without giving any clues as to how the project operates on the inside. My team has chosen a different direction, disregarded the traditional design part almost entirely and instead focused on feasibility research.</p>
